<p>I unified the scripts for pulling in bucket pressure sensor and ambient pressure sensor data, so that they had identical timestamps, so that I could just subtract one from the other as a correction (see attached graphs. I tried to keep the y-axis scale the same for all graphs, and use a similar visual metric, so you can assess the relative correction.)</p>
<p>Then: I spent the last few days tracking down sources of noise in the conductivity expt. It was pretty good, but had a weird periodic wiggle / drift ... I did all the signal-chain things I could think of (made a better probe, shortened the wires for the analog measurement, compensated for temperature) ... but still a wiggle. Then thought: this has gotta be coupling in the measurement circuitry to fluctuations in power supply (a problem i'd had on a raspberry pi before). So I redid the conductivity measurement code on a radio-based microcontroller, and made the entire experiment battery-powered, broadcasting its data to another radio connected to the RPi. Now it's supersmooth!</p>
<p>So: both depth sensor and conductivity sensor seem quite stable now!</p>
<p>From the exchange with Liz Glivinski a while back:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For your calibrations, the Federal chloride standards translate to about 875-925 uS/cm for chronic exceedance and 2500-3000 uS/cm for acute exceedances. I will be in the office everyday expect Friday this week and next so feel free to give me a buzz if you have any questions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I did a rough calibration on the sensor to get things into specific conductivity units; I think the current setup I've got can do up to around 3500 uS/cm; and on that ~14 hour run, it looks like the standard deviation in the conductivity sensor for a solution around 1400 uS/cm is about 4 uS/cm. So I'm getting pretty confident that we could pretty solidly distinguish 'below 900 uS/cm&quot; from &quot;somewhere 900 uS/cm and 2800&quot; from &quot;significantly above 3000 uS/cm&quot;. The next step for conductivity might be: make the prototype more solid, and co-deploy it alongside established sensors, to see how it behaves in the field.</p>
